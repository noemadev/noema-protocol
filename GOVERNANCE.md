# Governance

This document describes how decisions are made for Noema Protocol.

Noema Protocol is currently in beta and follows
a maintainer-led governance model.

---

## Governance Model

Noema Protocol is governed by its maintainers.

Maintainers are responsible for:
- Defining protocol direction
- Reviewing and merging contributions
- Managing releases and versioning
- Handling security reports
- Approving or rejecting RFCs

---

## Decision Making

### Minor Changes
Minor documentation updates, clarifications,
and non-breaking adjustments may be merged
directly by maintainers.

### Major Changes
Breaking or significant changes to the protocol
require an approved RFC.

RFCs must clearly describe:
- Motivation
- Design impact
- Compatibility considerations

---

## RFC Process

1. Proposal is submitted as an RFC
2. Maintainers review and discuss the proposal
3. Feedback may result in revisions
4. Maintainers approve or reject the RFC
5. Approved RFCs are scheduled and documented

---

## Transparency

- All design discussions occur publicly via RFCs and issues
- Decisions are documented and traceable
- Changelogs reflect accepted changes

---

## Maintainers

The current list of maintainers is published
in the `MAINTAINERS.md` file.

---

## Evolution

As Noema Protocol matures, the governance model
may evolve to include additional maintainers
or alternative decision processes.
