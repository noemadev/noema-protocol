Noema Protocol
==============

Noema is an experimental protocol for constructing
autonomous AI agents and composable intelligence systems.

This repository defines the protocol surface,
design constraints, and system architecture.

It is not an application.
It is not a product.

OVERVIEW
--------

Noema provides a low-level framework for building
intelligent agents that can reason, act, and evolve
across heterogeneous environments.

The protocol is designed to be modular, extensible,
and implementation-agnostic.

GOALS
-----

- define a clear agent-oriented protocol
- enable composable cognitive systems
- separate reasoning from execution
- support onchain and offchain coordination
- remain minimal and explicit

NON-GOALS
---------

- end-user applications
- UI-first abstractions
- opinionated business logic
- hype-driven features

SYSTEM MODEL
------------

At a high level, Noema treats intelligence as a system
composed of independent but interoperable components:

- cognition      : reasoning and decision making
- memory         : state, context, and persistence
- execution      : action dispatch and side effects
- interfaces     : external tools and environments

DESIGN PRINCIPLES
-----------------

- composability over completeness
- explicit interfaces over magic
- systems before features
- correctness before scale
