# Roadmap

This document outlines the current direction of Noema Protocol.

The roadmap represents intent and priorities, not guarantees.
Timelines may change as the protocol evolves.

---

## Current Phase: Beta

The focus during beta is architectural clarity and specification
stability rather than feature completeness.

---

## Near Term (Beta)

- Define core protocol concepts and terminology
- Formalize separation between reasoning, memory, and execution
- Establish RFC workflow for protocol changes
- Expand documentation for system architecture
- Clarify onchain and offchain execution boundaries

---

## Mid Term

- Refine protocol interfaces based on early feedback
- Publish reference patterns for agent construction
- Improve interoperability guidelines
- Add conformance and behavior notes

---

## Long Term

- Stabilize protocol specification
- Define compatibility and versioning guarantees
- Support multiple independent implementations
- Move toward a stable `1.0.0` specification

---

## Out of Scope

The following are intentionally not part of the roadmap:

- End-user applications
- UI-first features
- Model-specific optimizations
- Product-level integrations

---

## Notes

Noema Protocol prioritizes correctness, simplicity,
and explicit system design over rapid feature expansion.

Progress is measured by clarity and reliability,
not release frequency.
