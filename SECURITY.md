# Security Policy

This document describes the security policy for Noema Protocol.

Noema Protocol is currently in beta.
Security considerations focus on responsible disclosure
and transparent handling of reported issues.

---

## Supported Versions

During the beta phase, Noema Protocol does not provide
formal security guarantees.

Security fixes are applied on a best-effort basis
to the most recent development state.

---

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security issue, please report it responsibly.

- Do NOT open a public GitHub issue
- Do NOT disclose the issue publicly before coordination

Preferred reporting methods:
- GitHub Security Advisories (if enabled)
- Private communication with the maintainers listed in `MAINTAINERS.md`

---

## What to Include in a Report

Please include:
- A clear description of the issue
- Steps to reproduce (if applicable)
- Potential impact
- Any relevant references or proof-of-concept

---

## Response Process

- Reports will be acknowledged as soon as possible
- Maintainers will assess severity and scope
- Mitigation plans will be communicated privately
- Public disclosure will occur after a fix or mitigation is available

---

## Scope

This policy applies to:
- Protocol specifications
- Documentation
- Reference materials in this repository

It does not cover third-party implementations
or downstream integrations.

---

## Notes

Security during beta focuses on process clarity
and responsible coordination rather than guarantees.

As the protocol matures, this policy may evolve.
