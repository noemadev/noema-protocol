# Noema Protocol Documentation

This documentation describes the design, concepts,
and specification of Noema Protocol.

Noema Protocol is an experimental framework for building
autonomous AI systems through explicit architecture.

---

## What Is Noema?

Noema is a protocol for constructing AI agents
that can think, remember, and act as part of a system.

It focuses on structure and behavior rather than
interfaces or user-facing applications.

---

## Documentation Scope

This documentation covers:

- Core concepts and terminology
- System architecture and design principles
- Protocol components and responsibilities
- Guidelines for extending and implementing the protocol

This documentation does NOT cover:

- End-user applications
- UI or product features
- Model-specific optimizations
- Deployment or infrastructure details

---

## Core Concepts

Noema separates intelligence into clear components:

- **Reasoning**  
  Decision-making logic that evaluates goals and context.

- **Memory**  
  Persistent state and contextual information across time.

- **Execution**  
  Actions performed by agents and their effects on systems.

These components are designed to be composable
and independently replaceable.

## How to Read This Documentation

Recommended order:

1. Architecture overview  
2. Core concepts  
3. Protocol components  
4. Guides and references

Each section is written to be readable independently,
but together they describe a coherent system.

---

## Status

Noema Protocol is currently in beta.

Specifications may change.
Interfaces are not yet stable.
Documentation will evolve with the protocol.

---

## Next Sections

- `architecture.md` — system overview and structure  
- `concepts.md` — key ideas and definitions  
- `protocol/` — detailed protocol components  
- `guides/` — practical notes and contribution guides

---

Noema prioritizes clarity, correctness,
and long-term system design over rapid iteration.
